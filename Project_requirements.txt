Secure Job Search & Professional Networking Platform

1 Introduction
The Secure Job Search and Professional Networking Platform is intended to provide end-to-end security
for professional interactions, private messaging, resume sharing, and job application workflows. The
goal is to build a robust system that ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data
while integrating strong user validation mechanisms, OTP-based authentication, PKI-backed trust, and
tamper-evident auditing.

The platform supports user profiles, professional connections, company pages, job postings, applica-
tion tracking, and recruiter–candidate communication. Security, privacy, and access control are first-class

requirements throughout the system.
2 Requirements
Below are the key functional and security requirements for the platform.
A. User Profiles and Connections
• Users can create and edit profiles, including name, headline, location, education, experience, skills,
profile picture, and bio.
• Field-level privacy controls:
– Public
– Connections-only
– Private
• Users can send, accept, and remove professional connection requests.
• Users can view a limited connection graph restricted to their connections.
• Profile viewer count and recent viewers list with opt-out privacy controls.
B. Company Pages and Job Posting
• Recruiters can create company pages with the company name, description, location, and website.
• Companies can post job listings with title, description, required skills, location (remote/on-site),
salary range (optional), and application deadline.
• Company administrators can manage job listings, view applicants, and message candidates.
C. Job Search and Application Tracking
• Job search by keywords, company, location, skill tags, and filters (remote, internship, full-time).
• Users can apply to jobs by submitting a resume and a short cover note.
• Application status tracking: Applied, Reviewed, Interviewed, Rejected, Offer.
• Recruiters can shortlist candidates, add notes, and update application status.

D. Secure Resume Upload and Storage
• Resume upload in PDF or DOCX format.
• All resumes must be encrypted at rest.
• Strict access control: only the owner, authorized recruiters, and admins may access resumes.
• Uploaded resumes must be treated as sensitive assets.
E. Secure Messaging
• One-to-one and small group messaging (e.g., recruiter and candidate).
• End-to-end encryption (E2EE) for private conversations.
• The server must store only ciphertext for E2EE chats.
• Optional server-side encrypted messaging for non-sensitive announcements.
F. Authentication and Account Security
• Secure user registration and login.
• Email and mobile OTP verification.
• OTP-based verification for high-risk actions.
• Optional two-factor authentication (TOTP or simulated hardware token).
G. Admin and Moderation
• Admin dashboard to view and manage all users.
• Admins can suspend or delete accounts violating platform policies.
• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
– Regular User
– Recruiter / Company Admin
– Platform Admin
H. Security Mandates
• Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
– All traffic must use HTTPS (TLS).
– At least two functions must use PKI (e.g., message signing, resume integrity verification,
company verification).
• OTP with Virtual Keyboard
– OTP entry via virtual keyboard for at least two high-risk actions (password reset, resume
download, account deletion).
• Secure Logging and Audit
– Log all critical actions (authentication, job posting changes, application status updates, admin
moderation).
– Logs must be tamper-evident using hash chaining or a private blockchain.
• Defenses Against Attacks
– Protection against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, session fixation, and session hijacking.
• Data Storage Compliance
– Passwords must be hashed and salted (bcrypt or Argon2).
– Plaintext passwords must never be stored.
– Sensitive documents must be encrypted with strict access control.
• Scalability and Simultaneous Access
– The system must support multiple concurrent users without compromising security.
3 User Roles
A. Regular Users (Job Seekers)
• Sign up and log in using OTP verification.
• Manage profiles and privacy settings.
• Upload resumes and apply for jobs.
• Track application status.
• Send and receive encrypted messages.
B. Recruiter / Company Admin
• Create and manage company pages.
• Post and manage job listings.
• View applicants and update application status.
• Message candidates securely.
C. Platform Admin
• View, suspend, or delete user accounts.
• Moderate content and handle reports.
• Access secure audit logs.
4 Programming Languages and Frameworks
• Operating System: Ubuntu (provided VM)
• Database: PostgreSQL (recommended) or MySQL / MongoDB with justification
• Web Server: Nginx
• Backend: Python (FastAPI/Django), Node.js (Express/Nest), or Java (Spring Boot)
• Frontend: React, Vue, or server-rendered pages

Additional Information : One more added guideline i.e. It's not mandatory to use phone based otp system, you can use any otp method.
